need to fill the connection details first in the index.js

make sure that it is not the root but soe other new connection

create a new database 'emp-database' in that create a new table 'employee' with id,Name,DOB,salary,photoPath as it's columns

now go to the power shell and run npm install

go to the employee table and create a new stored procedure that is :
====
if _id = 0 then
insert  into employee(Name,DOB,salary,photoPath)
values (_Name,_DOB,_salary,_photoPath);

SET _id = last_insert_id();

else
update employee
set
Name = _Name,
DOB = _DOB,
salary = _salary,
photPath = _photoPath
where id = _id;
end if;
select _id as 'id';
end

====
then go the folder in which chrome.exe is present and run the following command:
# chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C:/Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security

then run "nodemon index.js"
